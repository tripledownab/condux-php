# Condux SDK for PHP

Report errors from a PHP app to a Condux relay. Emits the Sentry "store" wire shape, so the relay
normalizes it exactly like an official Sentry SDK — point it at a project DSN and it works.

Delivery is resilient (429 / 5xx / network failures retry with backoff, honoring `Retry-After`) and
**never throws** — a failed send returns a `SendResult`, it does not crash the caller.

## Install

```bash
composer require condux/condux
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Condux\Client;
use Condux\Level;

$condux = new Client(
    dsn: 'https://<key>@ingest.condux.ai/<projectId>',
    environment: 'production',
    release: '1.4.2',
);

try {
    do_work();
} catch (\Throwable $e) {
    $condux->captureException($e); // captures the exception's stack trace
    throw $e;
}

// or a bare message
$condux->captureMessage('cache miss storm', Level::WARNING);
```

## Verify it works

An error monitor's failure mode is silence, and silence looks like health. Prove the pipeline before
waiting for a real error:

```bash
CONDUX_DSN=https://<key>@ingest.condux.ai/<projectId> vendor/bin/condux test-event
```

Delivers one info-level test message through the real client and transport and prints the outcome
(exit 0 delivered, 1 delivery failed, 2 usage error — so it can gate a deploy script).

## Users, tags, contexts and breadcrumbs

```php
use Condux\Level;
use Condux\Scope;

Scope::setUser(['id' => 'u-1', 'email' => 'person@example.com']); // setUser(null) on sign-out
Scope::setTag('plan', 'business');                                // a null value removes a tag
Scope::setContext('subscription', ['seats' => 12]);
Scope::addBreadcrumb('job started', category: 'worker', level: Level::INFO);
```

Everything set here rides every subsequent event; the relay scrubs it at ingest and derives the
pseudonymous users-affected count from the user fields. The trail keeps the newest 30 breadcrumbs.

The scope is static, which is what makes it ambient — the code that sets a user does not have to reach
the client that reports. PHP tears the process down between requests, so it resets on its own; in a
long-lived worker (queue, Octane) call `Scope::clear()` between jobs.

### Request detail belongs to the event, not the scope

Classic PHP is share-nothing, so the static `Scope` is already per request there. That stops being true
under a worker runtime (Swoole, RoadRunner, FrankenPHP worker mode), where the process is reused across
requests and static state carries over. Passing request detail per event is correct in both, so it is
the safe habit regardless of how the app is served:

```php
$client->captureException($error, false, CaptureContext::forRequest('/checkout?step=2', 'POST'));
```

Tags on a `CaptureContext` merge over the ambient ones for that event only. Headers are deliberately
never sent, since they carry cookies and authorization.

## Develop

```bash
php test/run.php
```

Zero runtime dependencies (`ext-curl` + `ext-json`, both standard). The transport, sleep, and clock are
injectable (constructor `transport:`, `sleep:`, `clock:`), so the tests exercise the retry/backoff with
no real network or timers. `test/run.php` loads every `test/*_test.php` suite and reports the total.
